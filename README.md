# Python-based-Frameworks-to-handle-Distinct-Roles
Below is a Python-based framework for handling two distinct roles: AI Software Integration Expert and Digital Marketing Manager. The solution includes automation to assist with job-specific tasks, such as integrating AI tools with business systems for Position 1 and managing marketing campaigns for Position 2.
Position 1: AI Software Integration Expert
Python Code for AI System Integration

This script demonstrates how to integrate an AI tool (e.g., OpenAI) into an existing CRM system such as Salesforce.

import openai
import requests

# Set API keys and endpoints
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key"
SALESFORCE_API_URL = "https://your_salesforce_instance.salesforce.com"
SALESFORCE_ACCESS_TOKEN = "your_salesforce_access_token"

# Initialize OpenAI API
openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY

# Function to analyze and recommend AI tools
def recommend_ai_tools(requirements):
    prompt = f"Based on the following business requirements, recommend suitable AI tools: {requirements}"
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="gpt-4",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Function to integrate AI with Salesforce
def integrate_ai_with_crm(data):
    # Example: Add a lead to Salesforce
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {SALESFORCE_ACCESS_TOKEN}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    response = requests.post(
        f"{SALESFORCE_API_URL}/services/data/vXX.X/sobjects/Lead/",
        json=data,
        headers=headers
    )
    if response.status_code == 201:
        return "Lead successfully added to Salesforce."
    else:
        return f"Failed to add lead: {response.text}"

# Example workflow
business_requirements = "We need a chatbot for customer service and predictive analytics for sales."
ai_recommendations = recommend_ai_tools(business_requirements)
print("AI Recommendations:", ai_recommendations)

lead_data = {
    "LastName": "Doe",
    "Company": "Example Inc.",
    "Email": "jdoe@example.com",
    "Status": "Open"
}
integration_result = integrate_ai_with_crm(lead_data)
print("Integration Result:", integration_result)

Position 2: Digital Marketing Manager
Python Code for Campaign Management and Automation

This script manages digital campaigns by automating SEO keyword analysis and running social media posts via APIs.

from googleapiclient.discovery import build
import tweepy

# Set API keys and tokens
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your_google_api_key"
TWITTER_API_KEY = "your_twitter_api_key"
TWITTER_API_SECRET = "your_twitter_api_secret"
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN = "your_twitter_access_token"
TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET = "your_twitter_access_secret"

# Function for SEO Keyword Analysis using Google Search Console API
def analyze_keywords(site_url):
    service = build('searchconsole', 'v1', developerKey=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
    request = service.searchanalytics().query(
        siteUrl=site_url,
        body={
            "startDate": "2023-01-01",
            "endDate": "2023-12-31",
            "dimensions": ["query"],
            "rowLimit": 10
        }
    )
    response = request.execute()
    return response.get("rows", [])

# Function for Social Media Post Automation using Twitter API
def post_to_twitter(message):
    auth = tweepy.OAuth1UserHandler(
        TWITTER_API_KEY, TWITTER_API_SECRET,
        TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN, TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET
    )
    api = tweepy.API(auth)
    try:
        api.update_status(message)
        return "Tweet posted successfully!"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error posting tweet: {e}"

# Example workflow
keywords = analyze_keywords("https://yourwebsite.com")
print("Top Keywords:", keywords)

tweet_message = "Check out our latest blog post about AI and marketing! #AI #Marketing"
tweet_result = post_to_twitter(tweet_message)
print("Twitter Update:", tweet_result)

Deployment Tips:

    Secure all API keys using environment variables or secret management tools.
